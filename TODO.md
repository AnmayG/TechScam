Things to do:
- [x] Create the UI components for the Business class
    - [x] TextView, ProgressBar, Button, ImgView
    - [x] Have them interface with the Business class so that it'll change it on tick
- [ ] Create the background algorithm to calculate increases as time passes
    - [ ] SystemClock.elapsedRealtimeNanos()
    - [x] Check to see if you can diversify onto multiple threads such that each Business is on its own thread.
        - Made handlers for each one and it seems to work
- [ ] Clean up the UI
    - [x] Use a RecyclerView to continuously add in new LinearLayouts
        - [x] Make it interact with the RecyclerView based on the different Business values
        - [x] Remember to flip the blocker on and off so that it's not just empty.
    - [ ] Make it look nice and change the theme

- [x] Incorporate upgrades
    - [x] Managers feels like a bit much but it is doable
    - [x] Other upgrades is just normal things
- [ ] Figure out how to switch between fragments with a nice transition
    - [x] ViewPager is good.

- [x] Main thing is the RecyclerView part
- [ ] Write user info to a file so that it saves

- [ ] Implement goals/tasks so that the user has an incentive to select certain options over others
    - [ ] Timing and a point system like AdCap tasks?
- [ ] Deal with bugs
    - [ ] The business needs to be bought before it can be upgraded
    - [ ] An unbought business will continue to tick as long as it has a manager
    - [ ] Large amounts of money won't work
    - Going to be bugs with the money system
        - Need to get money working better
- [ ] Deactivate buttons and prevent them from purchasing things if they don't fit the criteria
    - This, the background algorithm, and the UI cleanup are the most important.
- [ ] Need to get the prestige system working somehow
    - [ ] Problem is going to be the background algorithm, might just be total money collected / some number
